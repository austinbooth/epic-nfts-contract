# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## hardhat.config.js
```js
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');

module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.0',
  networks: {
    rinkeby: {
      url: 'YOUR ALCHEMY.IO APP KEY',
      accounts: ['YOUR PRIVATE KEY'],
    },
  },
};
```

## Deploy contract
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
